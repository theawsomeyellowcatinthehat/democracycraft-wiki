# Lumberjack

As a Lumberjack, your primary task is to chop down trees. This job is at the center of the logging industry and provides resources for multiple industries throughout DemocracyCraft such as building, resources, commerce, and many more industries!

## What Lumberjacks Do

Being a Lumberjack isn't just about cutting trees like any other player. You have an exclusive ability known as the "Tree Feller.", this ability is given to Rangers and Lumberjacks, with a simple left-click, you can bring down entire trees at once. This special skill sets you apart from regular players and makes wood harvesting easier and more efficient.

While anyone can sell logs, only Lumberjacks have the advantage of the Tree Feller ability, giving them a competitive edge in the industry.

Not only can you cut down trees faster than everyone else, you can also turn wood products back into planks, accidently make too many fences, boom back into planks and ready for you to use again.

## Where can I farm logs?

There are 2 main places on the server where you can farm logs, the wild, and oakridge. Oakridge is the town with the industry theme of lumber, it's a town built for it, you can rent orchards to farm trees there. In the wild however is where you can get the most out of your ability, you can use /airport to reach a wild station and explore, finding new biomes using /map and getting all the lumber to your hearts desire!

:::tip Make sure to replant your trees so you can come back later!
